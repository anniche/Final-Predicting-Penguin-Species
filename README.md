# Final-Predicting-Penguin-Species


**Introduction and Background Information**

Penguins of different species vary in shape, size, beak length, etc. If researchers wanted to study how an ecological phenomena affected different species, being able to identify which penguin belongs to which species is going to be an important task. However, if there are too many penguins, taking all their measurement would be very time-consuming. Thus, it's important that ecologists or biologists are able to predict penguin species from a few measurements. Our goal for this project is to determine which features are most predictive of penguin species and build a machine learning model with optimal accuracy in predicting penguin species.
